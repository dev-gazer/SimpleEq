# SimpleEq

SimpleEq is my first Juce project attempt. Is it based on MatKat Music tutorial class given on YouTube at FreeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc&t=17349s. It is a pretty tough and advanced C++ challenge if you want to check it out. I suggest taking his classes as well. I will do so as my budget allows me to (https://www.programmingformusicians.com/pfmcpp/).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A C++ Compiler
- Juce Framework
- Any IDE you want
- Reaper or any DAW of your preference

#### Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dev-gazer/SimpleEq.git
```

#### Go inside the project 
```sh
$ cd SimpleEq
```

#### Open you Projucer to create the build

#### If you're a Linux user as myself, just type
```sh
$ cd Builds/LinuxMakefile
```

#### Compile your code
```sh
$ make
```

## How to use it

After the build is finished you should see a folder named build inside the LinuxMakefile folder. Go there and check if your VST has build successfully. There are a few options. The two most important are: a standalone plugin and a VST3 plugin best suited for DAW usage.

Here you can see an image of it running on Reaper.
